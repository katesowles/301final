### Group Members:
Yvonne, David, Kate

### Project Name:
Should I Bike It - PDX

### Team Name:
Node It Alls

### Problem Statement:
In the erratic Portland weather, it's hard to anticipate the weather on the other side of town, or even in the same spot after a few hours have lapsed.

Do you bike? Whether you're giving it a quick glance or a more in depth look, we give you the updates you need on the state of biking around your favorite spots in Portland.

### User Stories:
1. As a biker in Portland, I would like to know the conditions for the destinations I wish to bike between that day.
2. As a user of the app, I would like to have commonly-biked-to locations saved in the app to save my effort.
3. As a commuter, I would like to know that my method of travel is appropriate all day.
4. As a developer, I want to create clear, DRY code that adheres to the MVC Model.
5. As a user of the app, I would like to have it available on the go from my mobile phone.
6. As a developer I want to use object oriented, functional, decoupled programming.
7. As a developer, I want to leverage third-party information services in my app to save from having to manually collect the data ourselves.
8. As a developer, I want to harness the privacy allowed by keeping private data persisted on a server as opposed to being in the source code.
9. As a developer, I want to make use of middleware to streamline my information processing.
10. As a developer, I'd like to make big bucks off this shit. (ha!)
